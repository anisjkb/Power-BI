# Overview of Data Analysis

Before data can be used to tell a story, it must be run through a process that makes it usable in the story. **Data analysis** is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information. The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.

## Reporting on Trusted Data

As the world becomes more data-driven, storytelling through data analysis is becoming a vital component and aspect of large and small businesses. It is the reason that organizations continue to hire data analysts.

Data-driven businesses make decisions based on the story that their data tells. However, in today's data-driven world, data is not being used to its full potential â€” a challenge that most businesses face. Data analysis is, and should be, a critical aspect of all organizations to help determine the impact to their business, including evaluating customer sentiment, performing market and product research, and identifying trends or other data insights.

While the process of data analysis focuses on the tasks of cleaning, modeling, and visualizing data, the concept of data analysis and its importance to business should not be understated. To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

## Categories of Analytics

### Descriptive Analytics
Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large semantic models to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives. Metrics such as return on investment (ROI) are used in many industries, and specialized metrics are developed to track performance in specific industries.

**Example:** Generating reports to provide a view of an organization's sales and financial data.

### Diagnostic Analytics
Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events.

Process:
1. Identify anomalies in the data (e.g., unexpected changes in a metric).
2. Collect data related to these anomalies.
3. Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends.

### Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. These techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they're likely to recur.

Predictive analytical tools include:
- Neural networks
- Decision trees
- Regression analysis

### Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. These techniques help businesses make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty.

Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning to find patterns in large semantic models. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

### Cognitive Analytics
Cognitive analytics attempt to:
- Draw inferences from existing data and patterns
- Derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases
- Add findings back into the knowledge base for future use (a self-learning feedback loop)

Unlike structured queries, cognitive analytics deal with unstructured hypotheses, often using:
- Machine learning algorithms
- Natural language processing (NLP)

**Sources:** Call center logs, product reviews, and more.

## Example in Retail
By enabling reporting and data visualizations, a retail business uses descriptive analytics to look at purchase patterns from previous years to predict product popularity for the next year. Supporting data may help identify why a product was popular and if the trend continues, assisting in inventory decisions.

A business might:
- Analyze timeframe-based sales
- Correlate sales spikes with marketing campaigns or social activity

## Trusted Data is Key
An underlying facet of data analysis is that a business needs to trust its data. The data analysis process must capture data from trusted sources and shape it into something consumable, meaningful, and easily understood.

Data analysis enables businesses to fully understand their data through data-driven decisions, allowing them to act with confidence.

## The Role of a Data Analyst
As data volume grows, so does the need for data analysts. A data analyst:
- Organizes information
- Distills data into relevant insights
- Knows what data to gather and how to make sense of it

In a world of data overload, the analyst brings clarity and direction.
