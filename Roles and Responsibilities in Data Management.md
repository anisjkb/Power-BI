# Roles in Data

Telling a story with data is a journey that usually doesn't start with you. The data must come from somewhere. Getting that data into a usable state takes effort that often extends beyond individual scope, especially in enterprise settings.

Modern applications and projects are large and intricate, involving numerous individuals with unique skills and expertise working together to move from concept to production.

While roles like business analysts and business intelligence developers were standard in the past, the expansion of data size and variety has evolved these into more specialized roles that modernize data engineering and analysis processes.

## Key Data Roles

### Business Analyst
- Closer to the business side
- Specializes in interpreting data from visualizations
- Often overlaps with data analyst responsibilities (may be the same person)

### Data Analyst
- Maximizes value of data assets through visualization/reporting tools (e.g., Power BI)
- Responsibilities:
  - Profiling, cleaning, and transforming data
  - Designing/building scalable semantic models
  - Implementing advanced analytics in reports
  - Managing Power BI assets (reports, dashboards, workspaces)
  - Implementing security procedures
- Collaborates with:
  - Data engineers to locate appropriate data sources
  - Database administrators for data access
  - Stakeholders to identify requirements

### Data Engineer
- Provisions and sets up data platforms (on-premises and cloud)
- Manages/secures flow of structured/unstructured data
- Works with:
  - Relational/non-relational databases
  - Data streams
  - File stores
- Primary responsibilities:
  - Using data services to ingest/transform data
  - Designing/implementing solutions
  - Supporting data scientists and analysts
- Adds value by "data wrangling" to accelerate projects

### Data Scientist
- Performs advanced analytics (descriptive to predictive)
- Work includes:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Machine learning modeling
  - Deep learning experiments
- Collaborates with data analysts for visualization/reporting
- Often spends significant time on data wrangling/feature engineering

### Database Administrator
- Manages operational aspects of data platforms
- Responsibilities:
  - Ensuring availability/performance of databases
  - Implementing backup/recovery plans
  - Managing data security and access
- Focuses on database health and hardware
- Differs from data engineer role (less involved in data wrangling)
