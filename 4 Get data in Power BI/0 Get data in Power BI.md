# Power BI Data Import Module

## Introduction
In this module, you will explore how to extract and import data from various data sources into Power BI. As an employee of BANK ASIA, you are responsible for creating comprehensive reports that draw on multiple types of data repositories.

## Scenario Overview
You have been tasked with building Power BI reports for senior leadership. These reports need to pull data from multiple locations:

- **SQL Server**: Contains sales transactions, including items purchased, dates, customer information, and employee details (name and ID).
- **Microsoft Excel**: Maintained by Human Resources, holds data on employee hire dates, titles, and managers.
- **Cosmos DB**: Stores shipment data in JSON format through the warehousing application.
- **Azure Analysis Services**: Used for financial projections based on historical sales data.

## Workflow
Before building reports, you need to:

1. **Identify and Connect to Data Sources**
2. **Use Power Query for Data Preparation**:
   - Rename columns
   - Replace values
   - Remove errors
   - Combine query results
3. **Build Reports in Power BI**
4. **Publish Reports to Power BI Service**

Once published, your semantic model and reports can be reused by others in your organization. You can also build reports using semantic models created by others.
