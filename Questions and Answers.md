### 9. What are the data destinations of Power Queries?
Power Queries in Excel can be directed to load data into two primary destinations: worksheets and Excel data model tables. When data is loaded to a worksheet, it is placed directly into the cells of an Excel sheet, allowing for manual manipulation or further formula-based processing.

On the other hand, when data is loaded into the Excel data model, it is stored in a more structured format that supports complex data analysis and can be utilized for creating PivotTables, PivotCharts, and using Power BI features. The choice between these two depends on the specific needs of your analysis and the complexity of the data handling required.

---

### 10. How can you implement data security in Power BI?
In Power BI, data security can be implemented primarily through row-level security (RLS), which restricts data access for given users within reports. This involves creating roles and defining DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) filters that dynamically determine the data visibility for each user based on their credentials. The USERNAME() function can be used within these DAX expressions to tailor data access according to the user’s login information.

You can also manage security by setting up security roles within the Power BI service. Each role can have specific DAX expressions that filter the data within the tables of the model based on predefined criteria. Users are then assigned to these roles either in Power BI Service or through integration with Azure Active Directory, ensuring they only see data pertinent to their role.

---

### 11. Which language is used in Power Query?
M-code, officially known as the Power Query Formula Language, is the programming language used in Power Query to facilitate data transformation and manipulation.

It is a functional, case-sensitive language designed to be readable and accessible, especially for those new to programming. M-code provides a rich set of features that enable users to import, filter, shape, and combine data from a wide variety of sources.

---

### 12. What are the three basic concepts of DAX?
The three core fundamental concepts of DAX are Syntax, Functions, and Context:

- **Syntax**: It is the formula that involves functions. The result will show a syntax error if you type the wrong syntax.  
- **Function**: These are arguments filled in Syntax to give a specific order.  
- **Context**: Contexts are two types – Row Context and Filter Context. Row Context is applied to find a row in a table, and Filter Context is used when more than one value is applied to obtain a value.
