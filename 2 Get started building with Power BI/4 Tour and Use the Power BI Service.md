## 🗂 Organize Items with Workspaces

**Workspaces** are the foundation of the Power BI service. When publishing any report, you must choose a workspace.

- By default, every user has access to **My workspace**, which is ideal only for testing.
- When you want to share content with others, always create and use a **shared workspace**.

## 📊 Explore Sample Reports

If you haven't created a report yet, Power BI offers several **sample reports** for you to explore. These reports are loaded into **My workspace**, so you can explore privately.

You can access sample reports in the **Learn** section of the navigation pane.

## 📤 Distribute Content

In a workspace, you can create an **app**, which provides consumers with a simplified interface to access reports and dashboards.

### App Configuration:
- Set up the app
- Select content to include (only from the current workspace)
- Choose your audience

⚠️ **Important:**  
After making any changes to items in the workspace, you **must update the app** to reflect those changes to users. This allows you to control what version of content is visible to your audience.

### Why use Apps?

- Apps are the **ideal sharing solution** within any organization.
- Granting access to the workspace may expose more content than intended.
- Sharing individual items can be problematic if updates aren't ready for consumers.

You can also perform **on-demand refreshes**.
